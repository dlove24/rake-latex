#   gnuplot-latex-fonts <gnuplot file> [<font file>...]
#
# This script runs gnuplot on the file specified by the first
# command-line argument.  The optional remaining arguments are Type1
# font files that are included by the gnuplot file; the script will
# use TeX's kpsewhich utility to find where each of these files is
# located, and will construct an appropriate GNUPLOT_FONTPATH
# environment variable so that gnuplot can find these fonts.

    # dirname to extract the directory portion of the path.  Use sort
    # and uniq to filter out duplicate paths, and finally use paste to
    # glue them together into a PATH-like directory list.
